# faceRecognition

The objective of the project is to compare the inference times of face recognition models with and without using YOLO to finding frames labeled as persons and use this frame for face recognition instead of the entire image.

Instructions to run:

First we need to load pretrained weights.
```bash
chmod +x weights.sh
bash weights.sh
```
